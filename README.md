# Maven Toys: Sales & Inventory Analytics 

## Analysis of sales and inventory data from 2022 – Sept 2023 for a fictitious toy retailer in Mexico.


### Project Background

Maven Toys is a fictitious chain of toy stores in Mexico, with locations across major cities such as Mexico City, Monterrey, Guadalajara, Puebla, and other regional hubs. The company sells a wide range of toys across multiple categories and relies heavily on sales and inventory data to guide its business decisions.

In this project, I take on the role of a Data Analyst, collaborating with management and cross-functional teams (marketing, supply chain, and finance) to uncover profit drivers, seasonal sales trends, stockout issues, and inventory efficiency. The goal is to deliver actionable insights that support decision-making across the business.
